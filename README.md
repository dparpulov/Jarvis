This is the system I created during my internship at StudyPortals.
Designed and developed a CMS for Admissiontestportal - one of their websites. I used Laravel and MySQL to automate a manual and tedious job of dealing with a data set received periodically from an external source. Execution time went from 10+ minutes to less than 5 minutes and accuracy gets better with each new data set.

The data was received in an excel file and was quite dirty - had a lot of mistakes and they were different kinds. It contained information regarding english tests and their locations. Studyportals had their internal dataset of locations in a different format that was later used for the website. The previous method of cleaning it and getting it ready to get uploaded to the website consisted of copying and pasting through multiple excel sheets with different formulas. One of these formulas linked the received data to the internal data set. Usually, most of the locations in the received data stayed the same but some new locations were added and old ones were removed and this was very hard to incorporate into the excel sheets and updating the internal data set was not worth the time. This meant that the website was always missing informationand therefore losing users. My project fixed this and not only the initial working with multiple excel sheets was removed but updating the internal data set of locations could be easily updated.
